Questions To Answer:
    - Characterize the sensorsâ€™ performance and operation. Are they all working properly at all times? 
      Can you detect any unexpected behaviors of the sensors through analyzing the readings they capture?
    
    - Now turn your attention to the chemicals themselves. Which chemicals are being detected by the sensor group? 
      What patterns of chemical releases do you see, as being reported in the data? 

        - In order to determine if a significant increase is being detected by each sensor, the mean of all readings in the 
          sensor group was calculated, then the cutoff for significance was assigned as the mean + ( 3 * standard deviation).
            - Need a justification for why we chose to do this:

            - NOTE: This may restrict the data more than we need it to. We might should calculate the mean of all readings PER CHEMICAL,
              then assign the cutoff for each chemical.

        - Chemicals Detected as per our cutoff:

    - Which factories are responsible for which chemical releases? Carefully describe how you determined this using 
      all the data you have available. For the factories you identified, describe any observed patterns of operation 
      revealed in the data.


Data Preparation:
    - Sensor Data:
        - Rename column titles. The Date Time column has a whitespace at the end.
        - Need to convert the date time column to datetime in order to create visualizations.
        - Set the datetime as the index. This will make it easier to parse the data when looking to filter out certain dates.
        - Create separate data frames for each sensor

    - Meteorological Data:
        - Remove 'Unnamed 3' Column
        - In the elevation column, we need to add 370.0 to each record (I am assuming the elevation for each is 370.0??)
          Or do we even need this data? We can remove this column as well?
    
    - Company/Sensor Locations:
        - Create a pandas dataframe by hand from the word document provided (MC2 Data Descriptions)


**Justin's Homework**

- NOTE: keep account of what was done during process (see Data Preparation notes above) as well as time spent 

- last table in EDA\Megan_EDA_sensors_v2.ipynb, add a column for sensor coordinators
    - bubble graph (?) similar to coordinator
        - ie. color by sensor, size of bubble by magnitude of reading
        - explicit points for each factory, POI

- similar reading patterns but with hierarchy beginning with chemical -> sensor
    - chemical by chemical, may need to aggregate some since there are a lot of sensors

- see if absence of Appluimonia is due to faulty sensor readings, true lack of chemical, or other reason
    - check descriptions of data, look at gaps in geo plot of chemical readings for that specifically

- clean and necessary transformations on meteorological data, EDA and descriptive stats, work on incorporating into spatial analysis (bubble graph?)
    - consider temporal patterns (wind speed throughout day, picking things up on sensors, movement of chemicals)
    - vectorize wind speed in create graph of just weather before trying to combine
