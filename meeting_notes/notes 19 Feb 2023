Sensor Data
- Rename column titles. The Date Time column has a whitespace at the end
    - Column Names = 'Chemical', 'Monitor', 'Date_Time', 'Reading'
- Need to convert the date time column to datetime in order to create visualizations
    - Also set the Date_Time column to


Visualize Sensor Data based on the Sensor.
- Created separate DFs for each sensor
    - Determined the mean and standard deviation for each sensor. 
    - Graphed 'ALL' sensor data revealing 3 months of interest:
        - 2016-04
            - Horizonal line placed at mean + 3 std. This creates what will be determined to be a significant increase in chemical presence in the air (This could be a high cutoff but gives us a starting point)
        - 2016-08
        - 2016-12
- Created 3 separate data frames based on these 3 months.

- Some other ideas:
    - Can we visualize the sensor locations on a map?
    - If so, can we also plot the locations of the highest concentrations of chemicals
    - Gaussian plume modeling
